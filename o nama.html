        <h2> TEAM HISTORY </h2>
        <p>The Cavaliers began play in 1970 as an expansion team. Their 46-year history has been marked by both stretches of strong play and periods of poor play. In the 1970s, under the ownership of Nick Mileti, the team won its first division title in
            1976. That team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby "Bingo" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond, and head coach Bill Fitch, and was remembered most for the "Miracle at Richfield", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets
            4–3. They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go. Injuries, particularly an ankle injury to Chones, led to this team's demise, as the Cavaliers would lose the Eastern Conference Finals to the Boston Celtics, 4–2. It
            is widely believed among both Cavaliers fans and players that the "Miracle" team would have won the 1976 NBA Championship had Chones stayed healthy.[4] The remainder of the 1970s were marked by early playoff losses and eventually Fitch's resignation.</p>
        <p>The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. Stepien also oversaw the hiring and firing of a succession of coaches and was involved in making a number of poor trade and free agent signing decisions. The result of his questionable trading
            acumen was the loss of several of the team's first-round draft picks, which led to a rule change in the NBA, known as the "Ted Stepien Rule", prohibiting teams from trading away first-round draft picks in consecutive years. The ensuing chaos
            had a major effect on both the Cavaliers' on-court performance and lack of local support, losing over 50 games in three straight years. The 1981–82 and 1982–83 combined to lose 24 straight games, which at the time was the NBA's all-time longest
            losing streak.</p>
        <p>George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983. The team was in a transition as they went through nine head coaches between from 1980–1986 and only made the playoffs once in that period. During the 1986 offseason, the Cavaliers
            acquired Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance. Those four players (until Harper was later traded in 1989 for the rights to Danny Ferry) formed the core of the team, under the direction of head coach Lenny Wilkens, that led
            the Cavaliers to eight playoff seasons in the next nine years, including three seasons of 50 or more wins. Their strongest team was the 1988–89 team, who went 57–25 en route to the 3rd seed in the East, but these Cavs lost the first round
            to the Chicago Bulls 3–2, thanks to a game-winning jump shot by Chicago's Michael Jordan over Craig Ehlo.</p>
