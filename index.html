        <h2> SPECIAL UNIFORMS </h2>
        <p>Beginning in the 2008–09 season, the Cavaliers began wearing special "mash-up" uniforms (combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another) on select "Cavs Fanatic" Nights.</p>

        <p>2008–09: the team wore the original "Feathered C" uniforms but with the 1994–2003 shade of blue combined with the classic wine and gold shade. 2009–10; 2015–present: the team wore their 1987–89 uniforms, but in the classic wine and gold from the
            'Miracle of Richfield' era. This uniform was brought back for the 2015–16 season (with current number scheme in place of the 1987–89 number font), and became a third alternate uniform (fifth uniform overall) still currently used
        </p>
        <p>2010–11: the team wore the 2005–10 checkerboard alternate uniforms, but in the 1994–2003 color scheme of blue, black and orange. 2015–present: the team introduced a sixth uniform design - a black sleeved uniform that is used on select nights,
            featuring the wine 'C' logo in front. These were the uniforms worn the night the Cavs won their first NBA Championship in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. 2016–present: The Cavs are wearing their mid-1980s orange uniforms for select "Hardwood
            Classic Nights".
